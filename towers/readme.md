# Tower
Tower is an Application that allows users to create events for certain days with a limit of people. Other users are then able to attend events which take from the amount of available spots. Users are also to see what other users are attending as well as comment. The creator of the event can cancel it.

Utilized a node and express Back End with mongoose ORM and a MongoDB database. The front end is built completely with Vue.js framework. Used Auth0 as an auth service.
